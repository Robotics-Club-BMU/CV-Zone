# Image Resizing

* By using this code, we are resizing an image using Open CV.
* The we resize the original image to half, bigger and interpolation nearest versions of it.
* Many types of functions have been used in this code so, for better understanding of them i have added comments all over the programs, which you can check by clicking here - [code & it's explanation](https://github.com/tb-rules10/CV-Zone/blob/branch-1/Basics_of_OpenCV/Image%20Resizing/Code.py).
* And, after running this code, you will see a pop up window where you can see the the input image along with 3 resized images.
