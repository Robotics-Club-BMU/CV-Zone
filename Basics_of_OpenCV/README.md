# Basics of Open CV

OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis 
including features like face detection and object detection. Whether you’re interested in learning how to apply facial recognition to video streams, building a complete deep learning pipeline for 
image classification, or simply want to tinker with your Raspberry Pi and add image recognition to a hobby project, you’ll need to learn OpenCV somewhere along the way.

 It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. When it is integrated with various libraries, such as Numpy which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations, then the number of weapons increases in your Arsenal i.e whatever operations one can do in Numpy can be combined with OpenCV.

 ## Programming Languages
 
 OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc.
