# Restoring an Image

* By using this code, we are restoring an image using Open CV.
* Many types of functions have been used in this code so, for better understanding of them i have added comments all over the programs, which you can check by clicking here - [code & it's explanation](https://github.com/tb-rules10/CV-Zone/blob/restore/Image_Manipulations/Image%20Restoration/Code.py).
* And, after running this code, you will see a pop up window where you can see the the input image along with the output.
