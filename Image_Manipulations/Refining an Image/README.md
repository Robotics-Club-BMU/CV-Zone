# Image Refining

* This code is used to refine an image and make the text written on it completely visible.
* We have used a kernel to sharpen & brighten the image.
* Many types of functions have been used in this code so, for better understanding of them i have added comments all over the programs, which you can check by clicking here - [code & it's explanation](https://github.com/tb-rules10/CV-Zone/blob/branch-2/Image_Manipulations/Refining%20an%20Image/Code.py).
* And, after running this code, you will see a pop up window where you can see the the input image along with refined image.
