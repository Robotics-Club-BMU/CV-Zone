# Cartooning an Image

* With this code, we can create our own cartoon versions of images.
* You can click here to check out the [code](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/CV-Zone/blob/main/Image_Manipulations/Cartooning%20an%20Image/Code.py).
* On running the code, you'll see a dialog box from where we can upload the image we want to cartoonify and then we can see the output, i.e. the cartoonified version of the image.
* Same dialog box also gives us an option to save the cartoon image in our PC.
