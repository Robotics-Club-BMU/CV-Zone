# Image Manipulations
Image Manipulation involves the transformation or alteration of an image using various methods and techniques to achieve desired results.
As we know that , OpenCV is Open Source Commuter Vision Library which has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. So it can be easily installed in Raspberry Pi with Python and Linux environment. And Raspberry Pi with OpenCV and attached camera can be used to create many real-time image processing applications 
like Face detection, face lock, object tracking, car number plate detection, Home security system etc.

In this folder, we have various projects on image manipulations using Python & OpenCV.
