# Hand Detection

* We have made a Hand Detection project using Mediapipe.
* Many types of functions have been used in this code so, for better understanding of them i have added comments all over the programs, which you can check by clicking here - [code & it's explanation](https://github.com/tb-rules10/CV-Zone/blob/hand-detc/Projects/Hand%20Detection/Code.py).
* And, after running this code, you will see a pop up window where you can see your video and put your hands in front of camera for live detection.

## MediaPipe
What is MediaPipe Python?
MediaPipe offers ready-to-use yet customizable Python solutions as a prebuilt Python package. 
MediaPipe Python package is available on PyPI for Linux, macOS and Windows. You can, for instance, activate a Python virtual environment:          
`$ python3 -m venv mp_env && source mp_env/bin/activate`.
