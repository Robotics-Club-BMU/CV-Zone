* This is a Document Scanner made in Python, using Open CV.
* Many types of functions have been used in this code so, for better understanding of them i have added comments all over the programs, which you can check by clicking here - [code & it's explanation](https://github.com/tb-rules10/CV-Zone/blob/branch-1/Projects/Document%20Scanner.py/Code.py).
* And, after running this code, you will see a pop up window where you can see your scanned document.
