# Self Driving Cars

This project employs image manipulation and processing using OpenCV for creating self-driving cars. To train a car to drive by itself, we need to familiarise it with street lanes, finding them, and focusing on staying on them. This means a machine learning model requires expertise in identifying the region of interest by canny edge detection and hough lines transform to separate the pixels from an image that represents street lanes. This also requires masking and computing average slope points. 

Here's the [source code](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/CV-Zone/blob/main/Projects/Self%20Driving%20Cars/findingLanes.py) for this project.
