# Projects

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time 
operation which is very important in today's systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

This folder contains sone projects made using Open CV.
