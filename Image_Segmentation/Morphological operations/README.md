* This code is used for Image segmentation using Morphological operations in Python.
* Many types of functions have been used in this code so, for better understanding of them i have added comments all over the programs, which you can check by clicking here - [code & it's explanation](https://github.com/tb-rules10/CV-Zone/blob/branch-3/Object_Detection/Vehicle%20Detection/Code.py).
* And, after running this code, you will see a pop up window where you can see the output image.
