## Line Detection

* By using this code we can detect lines in an image.
* Detected lines are marked by a blue line.
* Many types of functions have been used in this code so, for better understanding of them i have added comments all over the programs, which you can check by clicking here - [code & it's explanation](https://github.com/tb-rules10/CV-Zone/blob/branch-1/Image_Segmentation/Line%20Detection/Code.py).
* And, after running this code, you will see a pop up window where you can see the output.
