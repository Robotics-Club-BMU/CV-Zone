## Line Detection

* By using this code we can detect lines in an image.
* Detected lines are marked by a red line.
* Many types of functions have been used in this code so, for better understanding of them i have added comments all over the programs, which you can check by clicking here - [code & it's explanation](https://github.com/tb-rules10/CV-Zone/blob/branch-5/Image_Segmentation/Line%20Detection/Code.py).
* And, after running this code, a file named 'linesDetected.jpg' will be created in the same folder where you have written the code, for making the output image easily accessible.
