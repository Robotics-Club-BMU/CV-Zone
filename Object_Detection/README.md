## Object Detection

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. 
By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. 

Object Detection is a computer technology related to computer vision, image processing, and deep learning that deals with detecting instances of objects in images and videos.

This folder has vaious codes which are used for object detection using Open CV.
